## Backend Installation and Setup Documentation:

Step 1: Downloading the Backend Project
Download the project files as a zip file and extract them to your local system.

Step 2: Installing Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
<pre>
  npm install
</pre>
This will install all the required packages listed in the package.json file.

Step 3: Starting the Backend Server
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the backend server.
Run the following command:
<pre>
  nodemon ./index.js
</pre>


This command will start the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when changes are detected in the source code.

Step 4: Accessing the Backend
Once the server is running, you can access the backend APIs locally.
Open a web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:<port>
Replace <port> with the port number specified in your backend configuration or the default port used by your backend application.
